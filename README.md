### <-- bridgin (with a pidgin) -->

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a nifty purple plugin that enables you  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to bridge multiple IM and chat sessions  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;across the various services supported by libpurple  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(icq , yahoo , aim , msn , myspace , google talk ,  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;twitter , facebook , identi.ca , and many others)  
  
this is a native purple plugin port of the [bridgin-php](https://github.com/bill-auger/bridgin-php) project - once the initial port is completed  
further development will be able to overcome the limitations of the original php/dbus script  
  
some new functionalities this will allow:  
* supressing echo to public chats of admin commands and status reports
* better handling of special forms such as '/me' , smileys , etc ...
* issuing admin commands in the standard form ('/add' instead of '?/add')
* painfree installation and automatic loading with pidgin
* running on a headless box
* running on a windows box
