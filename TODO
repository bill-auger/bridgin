high-priority TODOs:
	* ensure the ./install.sh script still works


potential features:
	* (in progress) GUI prefs though not particularly useful but perhaps just for fun
	* (in progress) remote admin commands
	* (in progress) remote non-admin commands such as /shoosh
	* (in progress) bounce disclaimer
	* (in progress) terse nicks
	* proper handling of IRC special forms - e.g. /me
	* /?who command (for all users) to list users on other networks
	* centralized server-side auth to manage/block multiple instances in same channels
	* compile and/or package binaries and/or find a debian sponsor


low-priority TODOs:
	* refactor the inner activeChannelsIter loop in bridgeStatsMsg() into an array of char* outside the bridged channels loop
	* refactor the inner loop of getBridgeName() into a findChannel() yield callback to g_find_custom on prefslist
	* handle empty input strings avoiding responses such as "no such bridge ' '" either one by one
		or refactor all command handlers into a dispatch function
